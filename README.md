I aim to create a tool that beats the financial markets consistently

Next-up tasks

Project A:
ARIMA with differencing
ARIMA + GARCH to predict risk/volatility

Project B:
Momentum / mean-reversion strategy + TESTING
MONTECARLO simulation for returns

Project C:
Compare strategies using Sharpe ratio or drawdowns

Final project:
Machine learning model (LSTM, transformer, or feature-rich regression)
